# PDFWF
Scalable PDF-to-text extraction workflow. This workflow is designed to run on
HPC systems and uses [Parsl](https://parsl-project.org/) to submit jobs to the
scheduler. The workflow supports multiple PDF parsers including
[Marker](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker), [Nougat](https://github.com/facebookresearch/nougat),
and **`Oreo`** (implemented here). Each parser converts PDFs to JSON lines files containing
the extracted text and optional metadata. The instructions and examples below
are for running the workflow on the [Polaris](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/polaris)
supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory, but the workflow can be adapted
to run on other HPC systems by adding an appropriate
[Parsl configuration](https://parsl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/userguide/configuring.html).

# Installation
`pdfwf` supports several PDF parsers which have separate installation instructions below:
- [Install Marker](#marker-pipeline-installation)
- [Install Nougat](#nougat-pipeline-installation)
- [Install Oreo](#oreo-pipeline-installation)
- [Install PyMuPDF](#pymupdf-pipeline-installation)

**Note**: You may need different virtual environments for each parser.

Once you've installed your desired PDF parser, you can install `pdfwf` into your virtual environment by running:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:ramanathanlab/pdfwf.git
cd pdfwf
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -e .
```

## Usage
Running the workflow requires having at least one of these tools installed (e.g., `marker`, `nougat`, `oreo`, etc.). See [Installation](#installation) for details.

The `pdfwf` workflow can be run at scale using Parsl via the CLI as follows:
```console
> python -m pdfwf.convert --help
usage: convert.py [-h] --config CONFIG

PDF conversion workflow

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --config CONFIG  Path to workflow configuration file
```

### Choosing a Parser (April 2024)
[`Nougat`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13418), [`Marker`](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker), and `Oreo` are designed and trained to parse academic papers of any scientific domain. Since there are no canonical metrics on how to evaluate parser output quality, it is non-trivial to compare accuracy in a meaningful way. Regardless, we conducted a small experiment on $n=380$ multi-disciplinary paragaphs amounting to $33,000$ words. 

Nougat appears to be more accurate as evidenced by slightly higher transcription quality overall (as measured by BLEU score) and the ability to detect rare domain-specific terms, in particular. Oreo, on the other hand, is faster by a factor of $4$ and has slightly lower but comparable accuracy as Nougat (lower BLEU but higher METEOR score). However, Oreo struggles to properly order paragraphs on challenging document layouts and does not filter out erroneously repeated words as Nougat does. Marker is dominated by Oreo in terms of inference speed and inferior to Nougat in terms of transcription quality. These results are not domain-specific. As of now, we suggest Nougat if you parse <1M papers. 

While PDFs of any kind can be parsed (e.g., blog articles, corporate documents) with any of these frameworks, it is unclear how accurate each of them is. Since scientific PDFs tend to have a complex layout, parsing PDFs should provide reasonable output as long as the layout is somewhat comparable to that of a scientific paper.

### Workflow Configuration
The computing platform, virtual environment, parser settings, and other settings are specified via a YAML configuration file.

An example YAML file for the `pdfwf` workflow is provided below. This file can be used to run the workflow using the CLI after updating the values to be appropriate for your system.
```yaml
# The directory containing the pdfs to convert
pdf_dir: /lus/eagle/projects/argonne_tpc/hippekp/small-pdf-set

# The directory to place the converted pdfs in
out_dir: runs/output-text

# The number of PDFs to parse in each parsl task
chunk_size: 5

# The settings for the pdf parser
parser_settings:
  # The name of the parser to use
  name: marker

# The compute settings for the workflow
compute_settings:
  # The name of the compute platform to use
  name: polaris
  # The number of compute nodes to use
  num_nodes: 1
  # Make sure to update the path to your conda environment and HF cache
  worker_init: "module use /soft/modulefiles; module load conda/2024-04-29; conda activate marker-wf; export HF_HOME=<path-to-your-HF-cache-dir>"
  # The scheduler options to use when submitting jobs
  scheduler_options: "#PBS -l filesystems=home:eagle:grand"
  # Make sure to change the account to the account you want to charge
  account: <your-account-name-to-charge>
  # The HPC queue to submit to
  queue: debug
  # The amount of time to request for your job
  walltime: 01:00:00
```

We provide example configurations for each parser in these files:
- **marker**: [examples/marker/marker_test.yaml](examples/marker/marker_test.yaml)
- **nougat**: [examples/nougat/nougat_test.yaml](examples/nougat/nougat_test.yaml)
- **oreo**: [examples/oreo/oreo_test.yaml](examples/oreo/oreo_test.yaml)
- **pymupdf**: [examples/pymupdf/pymupdf_test.yaml](examples/pymupdf/pymupdf_test.yaml)

**Note**: Please see the comments in the example YAML files for **documentation
 on the settings**.

### Running the Workflow
Once you've updated the YAML file with your environment, project information, and file paths
the workflow can be run directly from a login node using the CLI as follows:
```
nohup python -m pdfwf.convert --config <your-config.yaml> &> nohup.out &
```

The output of the workflow will be written to the `out_dir` specified in the
configuration file. The `<out_dir>/parsed_pdfs` directory will contain the
parsed PDFs in JSON lines format. Each line of the JSONL file will contain
(at least) a "text" field containing the parsed text for a given PDF and a
"path" field containing the path to the PDF. See the example below:
```json
{"path": "/path/to/1.pdf", "text": "This is the text of the first PDF."}
{"path": "/path/to/2.pdf", "text": "This is the text of the second PDF."}
```

**Note**: If the parser fails to parse a PDF, the JSONL file will not contain
an entry for that PDF.

See the [Monitoring the Workflow](#monitoring-the-workflow) section for
description of the other log files that are generated during the workflow.

### Monitoring the Workflow
Once you've started the workflow, you can monitor the outputs by watching the
output files in the `out_dir` specified in the configuration file. Below are
some useful commands to monitor the workflow. First, `cd` to the `out_dir`.

To see the number of PDFs that have been parsed:
```console
cat parsed_pdfs/* | grep '{"path":' | wc -l
```

To watch the stdout and stderr of the tasks:
```console
tail -f parsl/000/submit_scripts/*
```

To check the Parsl workflow log:
```console
tail -f parsl/000/parsl.log
```

To see the basic workflow log:
```console
cat pdfwf.log
```

### Stopping the Workflow
If you'd like to stop the workflow while it's running, you need to
stop the Python process, the Parsl high-throughput executor process, and then `qdel` the job ID.
The process IDs can be determined using the `ps` command. The job ID can be found using `qstat`.

## `Marker` Pipeline Installation

This setup will install the `Marker` tool in a new environment.

On a compute node of Polaris, follow the following instructions:

_Note setting up the local.env assumes conda, see [Non-Conda Env](#non-conda-env)_
```bash
mkdir wf-validation
cd wf-validation/

# Create a base conda environment
module use /soft/modulefiles; module load conda/2024-04-29
conda create -n marker-wf python=3.10
conda activate marker-wf

# install torch(vision) 
pip3 install torch torchvision

# Install Marker
pip install marker-pdf
pip install PyMuPDF
pip install pypdf
```

## `Nougat` Pipeline Installation
On a compute node, run:
```bash
# Create a conda environment with python3.10
module use /soft/modulefiles; module load conda/2024-04-29
conda create -n nougat-wf python=3.10
conda activate nougat-wf

# Install Nougat
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel chardet
pip install -r requirements/nougat_requirements.txt

# Note: If your system has CUDA 12.1, Nougat environment installation should now be complete. At the time of writing, Polaris uses CUDA 11.8. So, install the right torch binary using the command below.
conda install pytorch torchvision pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

This should conclude the installation of Nougat. Now, get a Polaris *compute node* to confirm it runs successfully in your environment.

```
# Copy a sample pdf file to an arbitrary location.

# Run Nougat inference on the pdfs with the command below.

nougat /path/to/your_file.pdf -o /path/to/output_dir -m 0.1.0-base -b 10

# This command should write a your_file.mmd file into your output directory which will be automatically created if it doesn't exist.
```
If `Nougat` inference ran successfully, proceed to install the `pdfwf` workflow using the instructions in [Installation](#installation).

## `Oreo` Pipeline Installation
On a compute node, run:
```bash
module use /soft/modulefiles; module load conda/2024-04-29
conda create -n pdfwf python=3.10 -y
conda activate pdfwf
mamba install pytorch torchvision pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia -y
pip install -r requirements/oreo_requirements.txt
git clone git@github.com:ultralytics/yolov5.git
```

Then set the `yolov5_path` option to the path of the cloned `yolov5` repository.

## `PyMuPDF` Pipeline Installation
On any node, run:
```bash
module use /soft/modulefiles; module load conda/2024-04-29
conda create -n pymupdf-wf python=3.10 -y
conda activate pymupdf-wf
pip install -r requirements/pymupdf_requirements.txt
```
to create a conda environment that serves the PDF extraction tools `PyMuPDF` and `pypdf`.
Both tools are lightweight and operational from the same conda environment.

## `pypdf` Pipeline Installation
Both PDF extraction tools `PyMuPDF` and `pypdf` are fairly lightweight and operate in the conda environment `pymupdf-wf`.

## CLI
For running smaller jobs without using the Parsl workflow, the CLI can be used.
The CLI provides different commands for running the various parsers. The CLI
can run the `marker`, `nougat`, and `oreo` parsers. The CLI does not submit jobs
to the scheduler and is intended for use on small datasets that can be
processed on a single interactive node or workstation.
